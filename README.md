## Excuse generator

Absurd excuse generator to get you off all your responsibilities. Worked mainly on abstracting the functions so they would be easier to update if I want to add more elements to my arrays. So went for a function, `getRandom` that then generates the random element inside the `getExcuse` function thanks to a loop. Quite stupid and easy, but also insanely entertaining.
